## Something personal

Welcome, traveller! You are reading my personal, semi-professional introduction to..myself.

My name is **Zolt√°n Nagy**, a pleasure to meet you.

I'm a programmer; I create websites for a living, and as a hobby I like to experiment with all kinds of technologies.
I've been into programming since elementary school, and studied it in all my life through university too.

I was one of those mildly geek kids who grew up on video games and got enchanted by everything virtual.
Since I got my hands on my first computer I've been hacking whatever I installed on it.


## Stuff I'm good at

My main talent revolves around web technologies like JavaScript, NodeJs, HTML5
and all that fancy thing that looks good in a browser.
And since JavaScript is such a hip language these days,
I'm glad I get to extend my playground to other platforms as well.
Like the mobile space with PhoneGap and Cordova, the server side with NodeJs
and even the desktop with stuff like node-webkit.


## What fancies me

If you are interested in the human as well, here's some stuff that makes me tick.

I read technology blogs and try to keep up with new gadgets, wearables and everything electronic.
I play all kinds of video games, from indie titles to AAA blockbusters alike.
I love my bike and use it every day as my main means of transportation.
I'm interested in Japanese culture, and mean to learn the language and visit the country as well.
I like to cook, and awe at modern architecture.

Lately I've been into video game making, pixel art and all that fun things.
Hope to create some time wasters for fun.
