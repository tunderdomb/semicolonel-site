I wrote this package because at the time all the scaffolding tools were unnecessarily complicated.

The sole purpose of a scaffolding tool is to eliminate boilerplate.
But ironically to make a project template you're required to write event more boilerplate.
So I created this simple tool that does what it has to in the most straightforward way possible.
