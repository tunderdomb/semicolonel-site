Node Manifest is inspired by the config file AndroidManifest.xml of an android project. It is born from the desire for a unified and simple way to manage a project from its inception to deployment.

JavaScript and the NodeJs ecosystem provides many solutions to problems that arise during development. We have a lively ecosystem of modules and libraries. But any little bit more complex solution requires some kind of learning curve. You have to be familiar with a new API at least. Maybe a new paradigm to an extent. Annotations? Sure! Config file (different for each module)? Why not!

By the time you are ready to code your project folder is full of stuff that is - strictly speaking - completely irrelevant to your business model.

To relieve you from some of this, Node Manifest provides a unified interface for your projects. YES it is a configuration file. That is a fact, but it may be the only one you should care about. It tries not to get in your way and still remain extensible and configurable. Words you might read somewhere else too, I'm sure. But I've read them too, and I never really was satisfied, because just a little boilerplate was always required. Node Manifest aims to be absolute plug-and-play.

The aim is to make development of simple to mildly complex web services and sites like 1-2-3.

This site runs on node-manifest too.
