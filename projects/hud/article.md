Hud is an experiment for a better dom manipulation tool.

Hud hooks into the dom with the `role` attribute of an element.
This approach decouples style (presentation) and behaviour (control).

The api is in flux with almost every major release, but the goal is to
create an interface for straightforward and maintainable dom manipulation.

## Some key features

  - custom element filter
  - widget based control units
  - custom events
  - position, viewport and various helpers for common tasks
