I once wanted to animate something really simple.

And looked into my options. I faced with lots of libraries
that did the job but came with lots of stuff I didn't really want.

So i  went and wrote this in a woosh.
A really slim animating tool for basic operations.

TBH, I was also driven by the temptation to implement
bezier easing,
but ultimately ended up using [this wonderful implementation](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing).
